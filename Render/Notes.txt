check uniforms




check normals and vertices size 



******
TODOs:

indices Mesh addData

binding and unbinding textures

references by Texture Class

fragmentshader.fs todo, should i use glEnable(GL_TEXTURE2D) and glDisable(GL_TEXTURE2D)

change up all the paramters and make them const stuff

replace input() todo

change up PhongShader and make it a singleton class
make private variables all static

Watch Companion Video on Lighting
Make-> float diffuseFactor = dot(direction, normal); //to see what happens, opposite shading?

Control k+d for all files

Optimize calculations for Mesh.cpp, instead of copying and pasting, do it all at once

draw() method for Mesh excluding use of normals too

change location of uniform variables in phongFragment.fs

phongFragment todo

refactor shader class so methods are all overloaded setUniform
change shader char* parameters to std::string&

make get methods return const values

make PhongShader class singleton

rename vertices to positions

rename variables in shaders to make it more comprehensible, in texturesVS, out texturesFS

**********
Notes:
Window->Reset Window LayoutWindow->Reset Window Layout

Remove default constructor of Texture since its not necessary -> Make pointer if should not need to initialize when declared

filesutils.cpp: return pixels instead of return result -> Library should clean up other stuff by itself, not just variables present

okay to use new, manage memory yourself

texture = Texture("res/textures/Hi.png"); vs texture("res/textures/Hi.png"); //second has error -> Visual Studio Directory

default argument should only be present when declared, only variable (without = value) should be present in implementation

universal zero initializer -> = 0;

emplace_back() better than put_back()
